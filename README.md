The PWA is online-only; offline caching is not implemented.

English-language educational mock store frontend at `/store/`. **No real
payments or transactions take place, and no goods are shipped.**

This independent repository is integrated at `platform/web/store` as a Git
submodule. It uses Next.js App Router, TypeScript, MUI with Emotion, Tailwind,
TanStack Query, runtime validation and configurable Grafana Faro/Umami.
Admin additionally uses TanStack Table; store/admin use React Hook Form.

## Local development

Use Node.js 24 and npm. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` if local values are
needed; never commit credentials.

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The application has a fixed build-time base path `/store/`. Run the platform
Compose environment for same-origin API/cookie testing. A standalone dev server
needs an explicitly configured API origin/proxy; do not weaken CORS or save JWTs
in browser storage to make a development shortcut work.

## Checks

```bash
npm run format:check
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Browser tests use labeled API fixtures and a local static test server. CI installs
Chromium before running them. For a running platform preview set
`PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL`. The tests validate UI contracts, not live backend behavior.

## Static output and containers

`npm run build` exports the site to `out/`. It requires no Next.js server,
server actions, BFF, or database connection at runtime. Detail screens use query
IDs because arbitrary runtime IDs cannot be pre-generated by static export.

The Dockerfile uses the official Node build image and serves the export with
Nginx. The platform Compose proxy reserves each zone's prefix and routes `/api/`
to Gateway. The frontend Kubernetes deployment is deferred. CDN provider,
production origins and environment values must be discussed with the owner
before deployment.

All `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are public, compiled at build time and require a new
build when changed. Set API URL, display timezone, app environment/version and
telemetry values using `.env.example`. Telemetry defaults to disabled until
hosting and policy are agreed. No secret belongs in a public variable.

## Authentication and privacy

Gateway owns the HttpOnly `ms52-session` cookie and browser session endpoints.
Mutations obtain a CSRF token first. Gateway and services enforce access;
frontend route guards only control presentation. Expired sessions require login.
Only cart product IDs/quantities and UI preferences are stored on the device.
The store PWA is online-only; no service worker caches private data or replays
orders. Every checkout is explicitly labeled as a demo.

## Design and integration documentation

The approved defaults and visual references live in the platform
[design direction](https://github.com/Microsserv52/platform/blob/feature/frontend-applications/docs/frontend/design.md).
See the platform [frontend documentation](https://github.com/Microsserv52/platform/blob/feature/frontend-applications/docs/frontend/index.md)
for routing, feature scope, package decisions, API prerequisites, local fixture
mode and verification evidence. antislop is applied during implementation.

Source was initialized with official `create-next-app@16.4.5`; browser testing
was initialized with official `create-playwright@1.17.139`. Each repository owns
its npm lockfile, checks, immutable image workflow and source history. CodeQL
on private repositories requires the organization's corresponding GitHub
security entitlement. CI configuration is included; remote workflow results
are not claimed until the branches are pushed and checks have run.
